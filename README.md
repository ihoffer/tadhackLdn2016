#Moodlight

_"Bringing chat room emotions into the real world with theatrical lighting."_

The app was awarded as "the best hack" at #TADHackLDN. Check out our presentation @29 mins: http://youtu.be/X41RbOKTrbE

The project comprises a single script (slackbot.py), configuration and audio files - see resources. The app works as a plugin in [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot).

Credit should be given where credit is due. The hack wouldn't have happened without the awesome projects below:
* [python-rtmbot](https://github.com/slackhq/python-rtmbot)
* [Algorithmia](https://algorithmia.com)
* [Hue](http://www2.meethue.com)
* [Riot](https://riot.im)
